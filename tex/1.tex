\chapter{Sequences and Series}
What is a sequence? What is a series? To put it simply, a sequence is an ordered set of numbers. A series is the sum of an ordered set of numbers. These can be finite, or infinite. As a rule of thumb, if a sequence ends in dots, it is infinite. Sequences can be a random set of numbers, but for this chapter, we will be working with real numbers.
\begin{example}[Sequence of Positive Integers]
    The sequence of the first $10$ positive integers is
    \[a_n=\{1,2,\dots,9,10\}.\]
    Here, $a_1$ denotes the first element of the sequence; in this example, $a_1=1$. We will use this defintion for the rest of this chapter.
\end{example}
I know all you coders may be writhing in pain, but we will stick to that definition of $a_n$ for now. Now that we know what a sequence is, we need to define a partial sum.
\begin{definition}[Partial Sums]
    For a sequence $a_n$, the $n$th partial sum is
    \[a_1+a_2+\dots+a_n.\]
\end{definition}
Sequences don't necessarily have any pattern, but later on in the section, we will explore special types of sequences, and special wayss to calculate their partial sums.
\section{Explicit vs. Recursive Definitions}
A definition for a sequence is a pattern for generating the $n$th term of the sequence. An explicit definition can directly calculate the $n$th term of a sequence. It contains any degree of $n$ in the definition, and only $n$. On the other hand, a recursive definition relies on past terms to calculate the $n$th term. Let's take a look at the sequence of all positive integers.
\begin{example}[Sequence of Positive Integers]
    The sequence of the first $n$ positive integers is
    \[a_n=\{1,2,\dots,n\}.\]
    The explicit definition of this sequence is
    \[a_n=n.\]
    The recursive definiton of this sequence is
    \[a_n=a_{n-1}+1\]
    \[a_1=1.\]
\end{example}
The most important thing to remember for recursive definitions is \textbf{ALWAYS DEFINE THE FIRST $k$ TERMS OF A RECURSIVE SEQUENCE}, where $k$ is the largest value of $a_{n-k}$ in the recursive definition. Otherwise, it's like trying to knock dominoes down: even if the dominoes are set up to known the subsequent one down, if you don't knock down the first one, the others will not fall down.
\begin{problem}
    Find the explicit and recursive definitions for the sequence 
    \[\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,\dots\}\]
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
    Find the recursive definition for the sequence
    \[\{-2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 14,\dots\}\]
    As an optional challenge, try finding the explicit definition for this sequence.
\end{problem}



\section{Arithmetic Sequences}
The first special type of sequence is an arithmetic sequence. This is where any two consecutive terms have the same common difference. This brings us to the general definition of an arithmetic sequence.
\begin{definition}[The General Arithmetic Sequence]
    The general arithmetic sequence $A_n$ for two arbitrary constants $a, d$ is 
    \[A_n=\{a, a+d, a+2d, \dots, a+d(n-1)\}.\]
    We denote $d$ as the common difference.\\\\
    The explicit definition of that sequence is
    \[A_n=a+d(n-1).\]
    The recursive definition of that sequence is
    \[A_n=A_{n-1}+d\]
    \[A_n=a.\]
\end{definition}
The common difference can easily be calculated by subtracting any two adjacent terms of an arithmetic sequence, as it is always constant. \\\\
Extending that, 
\[d=\frac{A_k-A_n}{k-n}\]
since there are $k-n$ differences between $A_k$ and $A_n$.
\subsection{The Arithmetic Series Formula}
We propose the following:
\begin{lemma}[Sum of Arithmetic Series]
    The sum of $\{a, a+d, a+2d, \dots, a+d(n-1)\}$ is 
    \[\frac{n(2a+d(n-1))}{2}\]
\end{lemma}
Now let's derive the arithmetic series formula. Here's a cool story that my parents have been teaching me since I was a child. It has been translated for your purposes.
\begin{remark}[Storytime]
    There once was a famous mathematician called Gauss. One day, his teacher gave his entire class a tricky problem: find the sum of the first $100$ integers. The whole class got down and started adding, frustrated. However, Gauss opted to avoid the grueling summation and decided to match each integer with its partner on the other side of the set. That is, he paired $1$ and $100$, $2$ and $99$, etc. Quickly, he found $50$ pairs of $101$, leading him to find $5050$ while the rest of the class was still stupidly chipping away at the problem.
\end{remark}
We can apply that thinking and write our proof.
\begin{proof}
    \[S=a+(a+d)+(a+2d)+\dots+(a+d(n-2))+(a+d(n-1))\]
    \[2S=(2a+d(n-1))+(2a+d(n-1))+(2a+d(n-1))+\dots+(2a+d(n-1))+(2a+d(n-1))\]
    We see $2a+d(n-1)$ appears $n$ times, so we get
    \[S=\frac{n(2a+d(n-1))}{2}\]
\end{proof}
Another way to think of this formula is 
\[\frac{n(First+Last)}{2}\]
This reason why should be pretty trivial. Lastly, we will finish this section off with a saying in Chinese that always helped me remember the formula
\begin{quote}
    shou xiang jia mo xiang cheng yu xiang shu chu yu er
\end{quote}
It simply means "First plus Last times occurences divided by two".
\begin{problem}
    Find $19+25+31+37+\dots+79+85+91+97$.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
    For an arithmetic sequence $S_n=\{a, a+d, a+2d,\dots,a+(n-2)d,a+(n-1)d\}$, find a formula for $S_k+S_{k+1}+S_{k+2}+\dots+S_{l-1}+S_l$ for arbitrary values $k$, $l$ such that $k\leq l$.
\end{problem}
\section{Geometric Sequences}
The second type of special sequence is a geometric sequence. This is where any two consecutive terms have the same common ratio. This leads us to our general geometric series.
\begin{definition}
    The general geometric sequence $G_n$ for two arbitrary constants $a, r$ is 
    \[G_n=\{a, ar, ar^2, \dots, ar^{n-1}\}.\]
    We denote $r$ as the common ratio.\\\\
    The explicit definition of that sequence is
    \[G_n=ar^n.\]
    The recursive definition of that sequence is
    \[G_n=G_{n-1}\cdot r\]
    \[G_n=a.\]
\end{definition}
The common ratio can be calculated by dividing two consecutive terms.
\\\\
Similar to an arithemtic series, 
\[\frac{\frac{G_k}{G_n}}{k-n}\]
Similarily, the thinking goes that there are $k-n$ ratios between $G_k$ and $G_n$.
\subsection{The Geometric Series Formula}
We propose the following:
\begin{lemma}
    The sum of $\{a, ar, ar^2,\dots,ar^{n-1}\}$ is 
    \[\frac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1}\]
\end{lemma}
Sadly, there is no story to derive this formula. But there is a really interesting connection between this and polynomials. It just so happens that 
\[\frac{x^n-1}{n-1}=1+x+x^2+x^3+\dots+x^{n-1}\]
due to polynomial division (you can try this yourself with synthetic division). This is one way to derive the geometric series formula. Or you can do it the "official" way.
\begin{proof}
    \[S=a+ar+ar^2+\dots+ar^{n-1}\]
    \[S\cdot r=ar+ar^2+ar^3+\dots+ar^n\]
    \[Sr-S=ar^n-a\]
    \[S(r-1)=a(r^n-1)\]
    \[S=\frac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1}\]
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}
    Compute
    \[\frac{5}{12}+\frac{5}{3}+\frac{20}{3}+\dots+\frac{800}{3}\]
\end{problem}
\section{Infinite Geometric Series}
One funny (and really cool) thing we can do with geometric series that we can't do with arithmetic series is infinite geometric series. First, we need to define convergence and divergence. Convergence is when the sum of a series starts to approach, or \textbf{converge} onto a point as more terms are added. Divergence is when the sum of a series doesn't approach anything, and in fact moves farther away from $0$ on the number line.\\\\
Geometric series, however, have the potential for values to approach $0$ as $n$ grows larger if the common ratio is less than $1$. Therefore, the series has the ability to converge onto a value.\\\\
A famous problem is the dichotomy problem, which details the story of someone trying to get from point $A$ to point $B$. Each turn, they move half the remaining distance to point $B$. Will they ever reach point $B$? It turns out, sorta. 
\subsection{Infinite Geometric Series Formula}
We really want to find a value for our dichotomy problem, but to do so, we have to eliminate the infinite terms. Luckily, since it's infinite, we can multiply our series by $2$. 
\[S=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\dots\]
\[2S=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\dots\]
\[2S-S=S=1.\]
Now we can apply this thinking and obtain our infinite geometric series formula.
\begin{lemma}
    The sum of $\{a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+\dots\}$ is
    \[\frac{a}{1-r}\]
    if and only if $|r|<1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    \[S=a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+\dots\]
    \[S\cdot r=ar+ar^2+ar^3+ar^4+\dots\]
    \[S-S\cdot r=a\]
    \[S=\frac{a}{1-r}\]
    Obviously, if $r\geq 1$, the terms can never converge, so the restriction that $|r|<1$ applies.
\end{proof}
If we decide to violate this restriction, we get really interesting values. This is the study of infinite partial sums. Though it technically isn't defined, we can apply this to some series with common ratio $\geq 1$ and get some pretty strange answers. Though it isn't an infinite geometric series, the Ramanujan Summation tells us
\[1+2+3+4+\dots=-\frac{1}{12}.\]
This is obviously false. Or is it? Srinivas Ramanjuan developed a very interesting derivation, which is explained in the subappendices.
\begin{problem}
    Compute
    \[\frac{1}{3}+\frac{3}{6}+\frac{9}{12}+\frac{27}{24}+\dots\]
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}[\textbf{Challenge}]
    Compute
    \[\frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{4}+\frac{5}{8}+\frac{7}{16}+\dots\]
\end{problem}
\section{Sigma Notation}
As a mathematician, I love efficiency. One thing that cosntanlty annoys me is writing out a summation, like $a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+ar^4+\dots$. Don't you wish there could be a quicker way of writing this? Well, luckily there is. Welcome to the wonderful world of sigma!\\\\
Sigma notation is an efficient way to write out summations or products (which is technically called product notation, but we're putting them in the same section).
\[\sum_{k=a}^{n}f(k)\]
This is sigma. If you know coding, think of it as a for loop. $k$ is the index of this summation, $a$ is the start, and $n$ is the stop. That is, it will sum $f(k)$ for every value of $k$ from $a$ to $n$, inclusive. $k$ will only increase by $1$ each time. 
\begin{example}[Sum of All Natural Numbers]
    \[\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}k=1+2+3+4+\dots\]
    The start is $1$, so we start with $1$. Then we add $2$. Then $3$. This continues for eternity, since you can have the stop be infinity. I suppose in that case, the summation just doesn't stop. 
\end{example}
Product notation is very similar. Just replace $\sum$ with $\prod$, and instead of summing terms, multiply terms.
\begin{example}[n!]
    \[\prod_{k=1}^{n}k=1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot \dots \cdot n=n!\]
\end{example}
You are allowed to nest summations, such as 
\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{i}j=(1+2+3+\dots)+(2+3+4+\dots)+\dots\]
However, something you are not allowed to do is have the index move backwards. This is not standard:
\[\sum_{k=10}^{5}k.\]
\begin{problem}
    Write $(1\cdot2)+(2\cdot 3)+(3\cdot 4)+\dots$ using sigma and product notation.
\end{problem}
